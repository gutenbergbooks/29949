<p>The position of eminence, the great respect and the profound reverence
in which the name of <span class="smcap">Washington</span> is enshrined in the hearts of the
American people, and particularly so, with the members of this
Fraternity, and of all true lovers of liberty and freedom wheresoever
dispersed, is the reason, if any be needed, why everything relating to
this great man and worthy brother should be preserved for the future
generations, to be used by them as a guide, in the cultivation of those
cardinal virtues of Honor and Integrity, that should ever characterize
the conduct of a good man and a good Mason.</p>

<p>The collection and reproduction of the letters of Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span>,
together with the text of this book, have been prepared under my
supervision, and its publication is heartily approved.</p>

<h3>FOREWORD</h3>


<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">Washington's</span> Masonic correspondence as found among the Washington papers
in the Manuscript department of the Library of Congress, affords an
insight of the great esteem in which <span class="smcap">Washington</span> held the Masonic
Fraternity, of which since his early days he had been an honored member.</p>

<p>This is further shown by his great courtesy to the Brethren, in his
replies to their addresses, no matter whether they were from a Grand or
Subordinate Lodge. In this collection, were also found some of the
original drafts of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s replies, together with copies of the
various masonic addresses and letters to him, and in the case of Dominie
Snyder, press copies of his answers.</p>

<p>In the present work an attempt has been made to group this matter
together in chronological order, also to show some of the surroundings
and conditions under which this correspondence was made, and of the
Brethren who were prominent in the presentation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> of these Eleven
Addresses, which came to him from Seven of the Thirteen Colonies.</p>

<p>A complete set of photostatic fac-similes of these documents in the
Library of Congress, has been secured for the Museum of the Grand Lodge
of Pennsylvania. Efforts were also made to obtain photographic copies of
such of the <span class="smcap">Washington</span> Masonic letters as were still in existence, which
were successful except in two instances as noted in the text.</p>

<p>It will be noted that on April 30, 1789, <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, while Master of his
Lodge, was inaugurated President of the United States; this is the only
instance where one of the fourteen Presidents, who were Members of our
Fraternity was a Master of a Lodge during their term as President.</p>

<p>The esteem in which <span class="smcap">Washington</span> held the Masonic Fraternity, is shown by
the fact, that in almost every case he had both the address and his
reply, copied upon opposite pages of one of his folio letter-books, now
in the Library of Congress. These copies are respectively in the
handwriting of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s private secretaries, viz:&mdash;Major William
Jackson: Tobias Lear: Bartholomew Dandridge and G. W. Craik.</p>

<p>In addition to the above copies we have <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s original drafts of
his letters to Watson and Cassoul, to the Grand Lodges of Massachusetts,
South Carolina, and Maryland, to Paul Revere, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> as before stated
press copies of his answers to Mr. Snyder.</p>

<p>A perusal of these original documents, as here presented, affords an
excellent illustration of the <i>entente cordiale</i>, which existed between
<span class="smcap">Washington</span> and his Masonic Brethren.</p>

<p>Upon the other hand, how the Masonic Fraternity, during <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s
lifetime, venerated their august Brother, is shown by the addresses of
this correspondence as retained by <span class="smcap">Washington</span>.</p>

<p>Also by the various Masonic Memorial services held, after <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s
death, the chief of which was in Philadelphia, under the auspices of the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. The Masonic services held in every State of
the Union, the many Eulogies and Sermons delivered and printed are
matters of history.</p>

<p>How this veneration of the great <span class="smcap">Washington</span> continued during the past
years, is shown by the fact that there are no less than 53 Masonic
Lodges in the United States, named after the illustrious Brother. This
is independent of the numerous Royal Arch Chapters, Commanderies, and
other Masonic bodies, that bear the name "<span class="smcap">Washington</span>."</p>

<p>Washington Lodges are found in thirty-eight of the forty-eight States of
the American Union.</p>

<p>The other ten States, which thus far have no "Washington Lodge" within
their Jurisdiction, are Mississippi and Texas, together with the newer
western States lately admitted into the American Union,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> viz:&mdash;Nevada,
North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

<p>In addition to the fifty-three Washington Lodges, there is also one each
in Canada, the Island of Cuba and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>In the Masonic Fraternity throughout the world, the name of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
is ever kept in remembrance, as one of the brightest luminaries in the
Masonic constellation, one of the most prominent examples, being his
full length oil portrait in Masonic clothing in the Hall of the Grand
Lodge of England at London.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments are due to the Hon. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of
Congress, for placing these documents at the disposal of the writer, and
giving permission to have photostat copies made of same; also to J.
Henry Williams, Esq., R. W. Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania and
Masonic Jurisdiction thereunto belonging, for suggestions and
encouragement in the preparation of this work.</p>

<h1>The Masonic Correspondence<br />
of Washington</h1>
<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">Much</span> has been written pro and con about <span class="smcap">Washington</span> and his connection
with the Masonic Fraternity. Thus far no complete set of his Masonic
writings have been compiled or published. Such portions as have been
printed were fragmentary, and issued for what may be called local
purposes.</p>

<p>How careful <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was of his Masonic correspondence is shown by the
fact that he had copies made, in his private letter books, of most all
letters sent him by the various Masonic Grand and Subordinate bodies,
and his answers thereto, usually upon opposite pages. He thus had both
the addresses and his reply at hand for easy reference. This fact shows
the esteem in which <span class="smcap">Washington<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></span> held his Brethren of the Masonic
Fraternity, as well as his own opinion of Freemasonry.</p>

<p>These letter-books are now in the Library of Congress, and photostat
copies of such as relate to Freemasonry have been made for the Library
of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>As to the authenticity of the Washington Letter Books, and how they came
into the possession of the United States Government is explained by the
following statement by Mr. Galliard Hunt, chief Manuscript division,
Library of Congress:<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small></p>

<div class="letter">
"They are a part of the Washington papers in<br />
"the Government's possession, purchased from the<br />
"Washington family, one lot in 1834 and the re-<br />
"mainder in 1849, and deposited in the Department<br />
"of State until 1903, when, by the President's order,<br />
"they were sent to this Library. They range in date<br />
"from 1754 to 1799. Some of them are partly<br />
"or wholly in Washington's hand-writing, and others<br />
"in the writing of his secretaries and their clerks.<br />
"There are no volumes of press copies, but there are<br />
"some press copies among the papers."</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Washington</span> in writing his answer to the various greetings, in most cases
would first make a rough copy of his reply, then digest, alter, correct
or change such parts or sentences as he thought proper. Then <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>after
deliberate consideration, a fair copy would be made either by <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
or one of his Secretaries and signed by him, and sent to the Masonic
bodies for which they were intended.</p>

<p>Fortunately some of the original drafts of these Masonic letters have
come down to us; thus far five autographic copies have been found among
the Washington papers in the Library of Congress at Washington.</p>

<p>1. Draft of letter written at Newburg, New York, August 19, 1782, to
Watson and Cassoul of Nantes, France, thanking them for the Masonic
Apron, embroidered by the nuns at Nantes, and which is now in possession
of Alexandria-Washington Lodge, No. 22, at Alexandria, Virginia.</p>

<p>2. To the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>3. To the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>4. To the Grand Lodge of South Carolina.</p>

<p>5. To the Grand Lodge of Maryland; this draft is a two-page letter
written upon a letter sheet and shows many changes and corrections; it
is dated 1798.</p>

<p>In addition to the above original drafts there were found several
addresses and the accompanying answers, which thus far have never been
published, in fact no mention of them has ever appeared in print, viz:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. An address from the Grand Lodge of Georgia, together with
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s reply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>2. A letter to Paul Revere, Grand Master of Massachusetts and his Grand
Officers.</p>

<p>3. An address from the Brethren of Prince George's Lodge, No. 16,
Georgetown, South Carolina, presented to President <span class="smcap">Washington</span> during his
visit to South Carolina, April 30, 1791, also his reply to same.</p>

<p>4. An address from the Brethren of St. John's Lodge, No. 2, of Newbern,
North Carolina, and the reply to same.</p>

<p>Photostat copies of the above have also been obtained which make the
most complete collection of the Masonic Correspondence of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
which has thus far been compiled.</p>

<p>A careful study of this correspondence so carefully cherished by
<span class="smcap">Washington</span> puts an entirely new phase upon <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s connection with
the Masonic Fraternity, and his esteem of Freemasonry.</p>

<p>These papers absolutely thrust aside all of the statements, arguments
and libels, brought forth by our misguided enemies at the time of the
Anti-Masonic craze during the last century, and in a small way kept
alive even down to the present day by some people who are blinded by
their ignorance or malice.</p>

<p>Referring to some of their published statements that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> never
belonged to the Masonic Fraternity, and that there were no authentic
Masonic letters nor copies thereof among his records so fre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>quently made
during the political Anti-Masonic craze, which swept over New England
and the Middle States about eighty-five years ago, the following
quotations from the Masonic literature of the period will prove
interesting examples.</p>

<p>One of the chief statements made by these people, and brought before all
their conventions and heralded in the public prints was: "That though
General Washington caused to be carefully copied in books kept for that
purpose, all his letters on every subject, no trace whatever of any of
the five letters under consideration,<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> nor any letters to any other
Lodge or Masonic body whatever, are to be found among the records of his
correspondence."<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small></p>

<p>The chief authority upon whom the leaders of the Anti-Masonic movement
at that time depended in their defamation of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, was Jared
Sparks of Boston, who at the time was engaged writing a life of
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, and then had access to all the Washington letter-books and
papers, and from his connection with the Washington correspondence, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>supposed to be the best qualified to pass upon their authenticity.</p>

<p>Another of the charges made by the Anti-Masonic bigots whose chief
object was to controvert facts was:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That although <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was <i>extremely scrupulous</i> in preserving
his correspondence with all public or private bodies, there is not
a line of his <i>relating to Freemasonry</i>, to be found among all his
papers, except the correspondence with Mr. Snyder!<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small> It is also a
fact, that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was equally scrupulous in dating his letters,
and it is believed that not one can be found, which is without a
date."<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that the chairman of a committee of citizens of Boston called
upon the officers of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to submit their
two Washington letters to Jared Sparks for his inspection. This the
Grand Officers refused to do.</p>

<p>In return Sparks sent the following letter to the Chairman:</p>

<div class="letter"><div class="right">"Boston, February 18, 1833.</div>

<p>"<i>Sir</i>,&mdash;I received this morning your letter of the 15th instant,
in which you inquire:</p>

<p>"Whether I have yet seen or had in my possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> any original
letter or letters, in the hand writing of General Washington,
addressed to any body of men denominating themselves Freemasons.</p>

<p>"In reply, I can only state that I have seen no letters from
General Washington of the kind described in yours, nor received any
communication on the subject, either verbal or written.<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">"I am, Sir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Very respectfully,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"Your ob't servant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"<span class="smcap">Jared Sparks</span>."</span></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Sparks could have overlooked the numerous entries in the letter
books whose numbers and folios are here quoted, also the drafts of
replies in <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s hand-writing and signed by him (copies of which
are here given in this work), can only be accounted for by the fact that
he must have been carried away by the political excitement of the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s connection with the Masonic Fraternity has been
exhaustively traced by Brother James M. Lamberton, Past Master of
Perseverance Lodge, No. 21, in his address "<span class="smcap">Washington as a Freemason</span>,"
from the day of his entrance into Fredericksburg Lodge, No. 4, of
Virginia, September 1, 1752, until the day of his death, December 14,
1799, before the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, at its celebration of the
Sesqui-Centennial <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Anniversary of the Initiation of Brother <span class="smcap">George
Washington</span> into the Fraternity of Freemasons,<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small> held in the Masonic
Temple, in the city of Philadelphia on Wednesday, November 5, 1902.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> made a public profession of
his membership in Philadelphia, Monday, December 28, 1778, when he
walked in procession with his brethren of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania, from the College at Fourth and Arch Streets to Christ
Church on Second Street above Market Street, Philadelphia, where, after
a prayer by Rev. William White, a sermon was preached for the "[Benefit
of the POOR] by appointment of and before | The General Communication |
of | Free and Accepted | MASONS | of the | State of PENNSYLVANIA, | on
Monday, December 28, 1788, | Celebrated, agreeable to their
Constitution, | as the Anniversary of | ST. JOHN the Evangelist, | by
William Smith, D.D., | Provost of the College and Academy of
Philadelphia." |</p>

<p>This Sermon was printed and dedicated to Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span> and a copy
sent to him, which was bound with other pamphlets in a volume lettered
"Masonic Sermons," and is so mentioned in the inventory of his estate
and now in the Boston Athe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>n&aelig;um.<small><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></small> At
this service over four hundred pounds were collected for the relief of the poor.</p>

<p>Rev. Brother William Smith, D.D., preached a number of Masonic Sermons
in Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland; three of which delivered at the
request of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania were printed, viz.:</p>

<p><i>Sermon 1.</i>&mdash;On Brotherly Love, &amp;c. Preached on the Anniversary of St.
John the Baptist, June 24, 1755,</p>

<p><i>Sermon 2.</i>&mdash;Preached on Monday, December 28, 1778, celebrated as the
Anniversary of St. John the Evangelist. With an Appendix on the
Character of Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus,</p>

<p><i>Sermon 3.</i>&mdash;Preached before the Grand Lodge of Communication, on St.
John the Baptist's day, June 24, 1795.</p>

<p>Original copies of the above are in the Library of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Rev. Brother Smith reprinted the above in a Volume of Sermons with the
following note:<small><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></small></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"N. B. The above three Sermons were preached at the request of the Grand
Lodge of Communication, for Pennsylvania, and contains in substance all
that the Author thinks it necessary to bequeath to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>the Brotherhood, by
way of Sermons, preached at different times and in sundry of the
neighboring States, during 48 Years past."</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By referring to the following letters and Documents it is shown that
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s interest in Freemasonry and the Fraternity continued until
the time of his death.</p>

<p>These documents cover the period from 1782 to 1798.</p>

<p>As these copies in our possession are photostat fac-similes of the
original documents in the Library of Congress, there can never be any
question of correctness or of their authenticity.</p>

<p>The finding and collating of this material will settle for all time to
come the question of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s connection with the Ancient
Fraternity, and his opinion and esteem of Freemasonry.</p>

<p>The earliest record we have of any Masonic Body proposing a masonic
address to General <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, was the resolution offered in King
David's Lodge, No. 1, at Newport, Rhode Island, during <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s
visit to Newport in March, 1781, while the French Army under Rochambeau
was quartered there. <span class="smcap">Washington</span> arrived in Newport on the sixth of March
and remained there until the thirteenth, when he left for Providence by
way of Bristol.</p>

<p>It was in anticipation of this visit that the Brethren of King David's
Lodge, of which Brother Moses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> Michael Hays<small><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></small> was Worshipful Master,
that a masonic greeting to General <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was proposed. The
following entry from the old Minute Book of the Lodge will explain why
the project failed to materialize.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="moses" id="moses"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Extract from the Records of King David's Lodge.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Regular Lodge night, held at the house of Mr. James Tew, Wednesday
evening, the 7th February, 1781. 5781.</p>

<p>"A motion being made that as our worthy brother, his Excellency General
Washington, was daily expected amongst us, a committee should be
appointed to prepare an address in behalf of the Lodge, to present him.
Voted, That the Right Worshipful Master (Moses Michael Hays) together
with brothers Seixas, Peleg Clark, John Handy, and Robert Elliot, be a
committee for that purpose, and that they present the same to this Lodge
at their next meeting for their approbation."</p>

<p>"At a Lodge held by request of the Right Worshipful Master, Feb. 14th,
1781. 5781,</p>

<p>"The committee appointed to draught an address to our worthy brother,
His Excellency General Washington, report, that on inquiry they find
General Washington not to be a Grand Master of North <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>America; as was
supposed, nor even Master of any particular Lodge. They are, therefore,
of opinion that this Lodge would not choose to address him as a private
brother at the same time, think it would not be agreeable to our worthy
brother to be addressed as such.</p>

<p>"Voted, That the report of the committee be received, and that the
address be entirely laid aside for the present."<small><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></small></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now as to the cause for this uncertainty how to address Brother
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, it will be recalled that just at that time, the proposition
sent out by the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania nominating General
<span class="smcap">Washington</span> as Grand Master of all the Colonies, was then before the
various grand bodies, but did not find favor in New England, in fact the
Grand Lodge of Massachusetts was the chief objector, and finally
defeated the scheme to elect <span class="smcap">Washington</span> the Grand Master General.<small><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></small></p>

<p>The means of intercourse between the different <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Masonic Bodies at that
early day were so limited and uncertain that it offers a clear
explanation for the uncertainty under which the brethren of King David's
Lodge, No. 1, at Newport labored at that time.</p>

<p>During the Anti-Masonic craze in the last century, the above minute was
extensively used by the political leaders of the Anti-Masonic party to
strengthen their claim that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> had never presided over any
Masonic Lodge.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Correspondence with Watson &amp; Cassoul, Nantes, France, August,</span> 1782.</h3>


<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> earliest letter of General <span class="smcap">George Washington</span> of Masonic Import known
is the one written while in camp at Newburgh in New York, dated State of
New York, August 10, 1782, to the firm of Watson and Cassoul in Nantes,
France, in which his friend, Brother Elkanah Watson was the chief
partner, thanking the firm for the Masonic Apron and ornaments sent him
from Nantes, France.</p>

<p>This apron is now in the possession of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge,
No. 22, at Alexandria, Virginia.</p>

<p>Elkanah Watson in his Memoirs states:<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Wishing to pay some mark of respect to our beloved Washington, I
employed, in conjunction with my friend M. Cossoul, nuns in one of
the convents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> at Nantes to prepare some elegant Masonic ornaments,
and gave them a plan for combining the American and French Flags on
the apron designed for this use. They were executed in a superior
and expensive style. We transmitted them to America, accompanied by
an appropriate address."</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the above extract is shown beyond all doubt the error in the
statement so repeatedly made, that the apron at Alexandria is the one
made by the Marquise de Lafayette, and presented to <span class="smcap">Washington</span> by
General Lafayette, during his visit to Mount Vernon in 1784, and the one
in the Museum of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, that of Watson and
Cassoul.<small><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></small></p>

<p>Following letter was sent to <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, together with the Masonic Apron
and "Ornaments," by Messrs. Watson and Cassoul, from France under date
"east of Nantes," 23d 1st Month, 5782.<small><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></small></p>

for your acceptance a small pledge of our homage. Zealous lovers of

in defence of a newborn nation of Republicans.</p>

American liberty, but its ultimate effect will extend to the whole
human family, since Providence has evidently selected you as an
instrument in his hands, to fulfill his eternal decrees.</p>

to offer Masonic ornaments, as an emblem of your virtues. May the

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owing to the uncertain intercourse between the two countries, it was
almost seven months before Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span> received the Masonic

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> next Masonic Letter of Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span> of which we have any

the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, which met at Alexandria, Virginia.</p>

<p>December 23, 1783, General <span class="smcap">Washington</span> presented himself to "The United

<p>Upon Christmas Eve he returned to Mount Vernon, whereupon the Brethren
at Alexandria, who, it must be remembered, were working under a

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No copy of either address nor reply of this correspondence has thus far
been found among the Washington papers in the Library of Congress, by
the present writer.</p>

<p>Brother Robert Adam, the Master of Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, was a Son
of the Rev. John Adam, D.D., and Janet Campbell, of Kelbride, Scotland,
was born May 4, 1731; he emigrated to America in 1753, and, after a
short residence at Annapolis, Md., established himself at a pleasant
country residence in Fairfax County, Virginia, about four miles from
Alexandria. He was a gentleman of refined taste, cultivation and wealth,
and interested himself in everything that could promote the prosperity
of his adopted home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>It appears that during his residence at Annapolis, he was made a Mason
in a clandestine or irregular Lodge, and in the year 1783 applied for a
dispensation from the Grand Master of Pennsylvania, to apply to Lodge
No. 2, for initiation and membership.</p>

<p>Brother Dr. Elisha Cullen Dick, Senior Warden of Lodge No. 39, was a
native of Pennsylvania, born near Marcus Hook, in Delaware County, about
1753, and died at Alexandria, Va., September 22, 1825. He was a son of
Archibald Dick, a member of Lodge No. 2 at Philadelphia, and joined the
same Lodge, September 15, 1779.<small><a name="f22.1" id="f22.1" href="#f22">[22]</a></small> Brother Elisha C. Dick was a
graduate of the old Pequea Academy, and of the College of Pennsylvania.
He began the study of medicine under Drs. William Shippen and Benjamin
Rush. After graduating he settled in Alexandria, Va., and at once became
active in Masonic circles in that city, and was instrumental in having
the petition presented to the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania for a warrant,
which was granted <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>under the name and number "Alexandria Lodge No. 39."</p>

<p>Upon the records of the Lodge, Brother Dick appears as both predecessor
and successor of Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span> as Master. Brother Dick was the
first consulting physician in <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s last illness, and also
conducted the Masonic services at <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s funeral on December 18,
1799. A biography of Dr. Dick is in the Library of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Brother John Allison, the Junior Warden of Lodge No. 39, had served as
Major in the 1st Virginia State Regiment, and later as Lieutenant
Colonel.</p>

<p>Brother William Ramsay, Treasurer of Lodge No. 39, was an old personal
friend of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>.</p>

<p>For a history of Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, warranted by the Grand Lodge
of Pennsylvania, February 3, 1783, which was constituted on the second
floor of a large three-story frame building, known as the "Lamb Tavern,"
on the twenty-fifth of February, 1783, the Masonic student is referred
to "Old Masonic Lodges of Pennsylvania," Philadelphia, 1913, Chapter
XLVI, pp. 153-168.</p>

<p>This tavern was situated on the west side of Union Street, between
Prince and Duke Streets, Alexandria, the site of which is now known as
No. 55 South Union Street.<small><a name="f23.1" id="f23.1" href="#f23">[23]</a></small></p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> next Washington letter of Masonic import in chronological order is
his reply to an invitation to join the brethren of Alexandria Lodge, No.
39, in the celebration of St. John the Baptist's Day, June 24, 1784, to

PENNSYLVANIA REGISTER, ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA, WHERE GENERAL WASHINGTON
ACCEPTED HONORARY MEMBERSHIP, JUNE 24, 1784.</small></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No copy of this invitation nor acceptance, has thus far been found among
the Washington papers.</p>

<p>The original of this letter is also said to be among the relics of
Alexandria-Washington Lodge, No. 22. As no fac-simile copy was
obtainable, an engrossed copy for same was substituted in the collection
of Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This banquet was held at Wise's tavern<small><a name="f25.1" id="f25.1" href="#f25">[25]</a></small> and was participated in by
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, who upon this festive occasion was elected an honorary
Member of Lodge No. 39, upon the Pennsylvania register, and thus became
a Pennsylvania Freemason, and his name is duly recorded as such upon the
minutes of Lodge No. 39.</p>

<p>This fact further contradicts the Anti-Masonic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> arguments based upon the
Snyder letter so extensively used during the years 1826-1833, that
<span class="smcap">Washington</span> never belonged to any Masonic Lodge, after his initiation in
the Fredericksburg Lodge in 1752.</p>

<p>The above note as recorded upon the Minutes of Alexandria Lodge, No. 39,
shows that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was in complete harmony with the Masonic
Fraternity; further, that by his acceptance of membership, <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
became a Pennsylvania Mason.</p>

<p>Among the cherished relics in the Alexandria Lodge, there is none more
valuable than the Masonic portrait of Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, which forms
the frontispiece of this volume. This was painted from life in pastel,
by William Williams, at Philadelphia in 1794.</p>

<p>In the year 1910 a fac-simile of this portrait was made in oil by Miss
Fanny M. Burke, an artist of repute, and a great-granddaughter of Thomas
Jefferson. This replica made for the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania is the
only one ever made of this portrait and shows Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span> as a
man and Mason, neither heroized nor idealized.<small><a name="f26.1" id="f26.1" href="#f26">[26]</a></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother Moses Seixas was born in New York, March 28, 1744; died in New
York City, November 29, 1809. He was a merchant in Newport, Rhode
Island, and one of the founders of the Newport Bank of Rhode Island, of
which he was cashier until his death. He succeeded Brother Moses M. Hays
as Worshipful Master of King David's Lodge at Newport. He was also the
first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Rhode Island. It was Moses
Seixas who addressed a letter of welcome in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>name of the Jewish
congregation to <span class="smcap">George Washington</span> when the latter visited Newport, and
it was to him that <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s answer was addressed.</p>

<p>The Town Hall at Newport being out of repair at that time the ancient
Jewish Synagogue on the main street was used, upon that and several
other public occasions. It is an interesting fact that this sacred
edifice is still preserved in the same condition as it was during the
Colonial period.</p>

<p>So far as known this address was the first of Masonic import made to
<span class="smcap">Washington</span> as President. Unfortunately, the exact date of presentation
and receipt of his answer is not known to a certainty, as there does not
appear to be any date upon either the original documents or the copies
in <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s letter book.</p>

<p>The original address and <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s reply to the Master, Wardens and
Brethren of King David's Lodge in Newport, the latter signed in
autograph by <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, are in the Athen&aelig;um collection at Boston,
Massachusetts.<small><a name="f29.1" id="f29.1" href="#f29">[29]</a></small></p>

<p>Following copy of the President's answer is taken from his letter
book.<small><a name="f30.1" id="f30.1" href="#f30">[30]</a></small> Both address and answer in the letter book are in the
handwriting of Major William Jackson, secretary to the President.</p>

Lodge of Pennsylvania. It will be noted that there is neither place nor date given.</p>

Ancient York Masons, beg leave to offer our sincere congratulations on your arrival in this state.</p>

<p>"We felicitate you on the establishment and exercise of a permanent
government, whose foundation was laid under your auspices by
military achievements, upon which have been progressively reared
the pillars of the free republic over which you preside, supported
by wisdom, strength, and beauty unrivalled among the nations of the world.</p>

<p>"The fabric thus raised and committed to your superintendence, we
earnestly wish may continue to produce order and harmony to
succeeding ages, and be the asylum of virtue to the oppressed of all parts of the universe.</p>

<p>"When we contemplate the distresses of war, the instances of
humanity displayed by the Craft afford <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>some relief to the feeling
mind; and it gives us the most pleasing sensation to recollect,
that amidst the difficulties attendant on your late military
stations, you still associated with, and patronized the Ancient Fraternity.</p>

<p>"Distinguished always by your virtues, more than the exalted
stations in which you have moved, we exult in the opportunity you
now give us of hailing you brother of our Order, and trust from
your knowledge of our institution, to merit your countenance and support.</p>

<p>"With fervent zeal for your happiness, we pray that a life so dear
to the bosom of this society, and to society in general, may be
long, very long preserved; and when you leave the temporal symbolic
lodges of this world, may you be received into the celestial lodge
of light and perfection, where the Grand Master Architect of the Universe presides.</p>

the brethren of your Society, and I accept with gratitude your
congratulations on my arrival in South Carolina.</p>

<p>"Your sentiments, on the establishment and exercise of our equal

purity of morals, and are beneficial of action.</p>

<p>"The fabric of our freedom is placed on the enduring basis of
public virtue, and will, I fondly hope, long continue to protect
the prosperity of the architects who raised it. I shall be happy,

<p>Upon the first page the four lines commencing with "Your felicitations"
and ending with "federal government" were crossed out, and as above
stated, were not in the reply sent to R. W. Grand Master Gist and his
officers.</p>

<p>In the third line from the bottom the word "regard" is substituted for "respect."</p>

<p>Brother Gist was the original Warrant Master of the Regimental Lodge in
the Maryland line, No. 27, on the Roster of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania. After the war, Brother Gist settled in Charleston, South
Carolina, retaining his old Military Warrant, and, in 1786, applied to
the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, to renew this warrant, for a Lodge to
be located at Charleston under the same number. This request was
granted, and Brother Gist was again named as Warrant Master.</p>

<p>At the formation of the Grand Lodge of South Carolina Ancient York
Masons in 1787, Brother Gist was elected Deputy Grand Master and served
as such during the years 1787-88-89, and as Grand Master, 1790-1791.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Correspondence with Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, January 3, 1792.</span></h3>


<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">During</span> the Presidential term of Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, the President, when
in Philadelphia, lived in a large double three-story brick mansion, on
the south side of Market Street, sixty feet east of Sixth Street, the
site of which is now occupied by three stores, viz.: Nos. 526, 528, 530.</p>

<p>The Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania then held its meetings in the upper
floor of the Meeting house of the Free Quakers, still standing, at the
southwest corner of Arch and Fifth Streets; this was but a short
distance from the presidential mansion. Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was
undoubtedly personally acquainted with many of its members, especially
such as had been officers during the Revolution, and were fellow members
of the Cincinnati.</p>

<p>On St. John's Day, December 27, 1791, a Grand Lodge was opened in ample
form,<small><a name="f49.1" id="f49.1" href="#f49">[49]</a></small> and the Minutes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>of the
last Grand Communication were read, as far as concerns the election of Grand Officers.</p>

<p>The Grand Officers upon this occasion were:</p>

<p>Brother Jonathan Bayard Smith, <i>R. W. Grand Master</i>.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph Few, <i>Deputy Grand Master</i>.</p>

<p>Brother Thomas Procter, <i>Senior Grand Warden</i>.</p>

<p>Brother Gavin Hamilton, <i>Junior Grand Warden</i>.</p>

<p>Brother Peter Le Barbier Duplessis, <i>Grand Secretary</i>.</p>

<p>Brother Benjamin Mason, <i>Grand Treasurer</i>.</p>

<p>The Rev. Brother Dr. William Smith then addressed the Brethren in an
oration suitable to the Grand Day, and the thanks of the Lodge were
given to said Brother William Smith for the same.</p>

<p>After which, on motion and seconded, the Rev. Brother Dr. Smith and the
Right Worshipful Grand Officers were appointed a Committee to prepare an
address to our Illustrious Brother <span class="smcap">George Washington</span>, President of the
United States; and this Lodge was adjourned to the second day of January
next to receive the report of said Committee.</p>

address and the answer thereto, shall be entered on the minutes.</p>

<p>This answer, in possession of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, is in the
handwriting of Tobias Lear, who was the private secretary of the
President, and for years attended to the details of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s
domestic affairs, and was liberally remembered by him in his will.</p>

<p>The letter was signed by <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, who had both the address and answer
copied verbatim in one of his letter books<small><a name="f52.1" id="f52.1" href="#f52">[52]</a></small> by Bartholomew Dandridge,
secretary to the President. A photostat copy of above, together with the
original answer by <span class="smcap">Washington</span> is in the Archives of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This address was read by Rev. Brother William Smith, one of the most
noted Episcopal preachers in Philadelphia, and the first Provost of the
College of Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania. Brother
William Smith, D.D., had been an active <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>member of the Masonic
Fraternity in Pennsylvania for forty years; he was the Chaplain of the
Grand Lodge of Moderns for almost a quarter of a century. In winter of
1778 he joined the Grand Lodge of Ancient York Masons, and for some time
served as Grand Secretary.<small><a name="f53.1" id="f53.1" href="#f53">[53]</a></small></p>

<p>Jonathan Bayard Smith, the Grand Master of Pennsylvania, was one of
Philadelphia's prominent citizens. During the Revolutionary period he
was an ardent patriot; he was among the earliest of those who espoused
the cause of independence. In 1775 he was chosen secretary of the
Committee of Safety, and in February, 1777, he was elected by the
assembly a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was a second time
chosen to this post, serving in the congresses of 1777-8. From April 4,
1777, till Nov. 13, 1778, he was prothonotary of the court of Common
Pleas.</p>

<p>On December 1, 1777, he presided at the public meeting, in Philadelphia,
of "Real Whigs," by whom it was resolved "That it be recommended to the
council of safety that in this great emergency ... every person between
the age of sixteen and fifty years be ordered out under arms." During
this year he was commissioned lieutenant-colonel of a battalion of
"Associators."</p>

GRAND MASTER OF MASONS IN PENNSYLVANIA, 1789-1794.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1778 he was appointed a justice of the court of Common Pleas, Quarter
Sessions, and Orphans' <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Court, which post he held for many years. He
was appointed in 1781, one of the auditors of the accounts of
Pennsylvania troops in the service of the United States. In 1792, and
subsequently, he was chosen an alderman of the city, which was an office
of great dignity in his day, and in 1794 he was elected auditor-general
of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Brother Jonathan B. Smith was an active member of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania. He was the Senior Grand Warden in 1786, at the time when
the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania: "<i>Resolved</i>, that the Grand
Lodge is, and ought to be perfectly independent and free of any such
foreign jurisdiction."<small><a name="f54.1" id="f54.1" href="#f54">[54]</a></small></p>

<p>In the two following years he was appointed Deputy Grand Master by Right
Worshipful Grand Master William Adcock; he was elected Right Worshipful
Grand Master in 1789 and served in that capacity for six years
(1789-1794). In the year 1798 he was again elected to that honorable
office, serving five more consecutive years (1798 to 1802), when he
declined re&euml;lection. The following action was taken by the Grand
Lodge:<small><a name="f55.1" id="f55.1" href="#f55">[55]</a></small></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On Motion made and Seconded the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania

Brother Jonathan Bayard Smith for the eminent services he has
rendered to the Craft generally and more especially for the able,
diligent and impartial manner in which he has discharged the Duties
of the Chair and while they deplore the necessity of his now
retiring from the Official Station amongst them which he has so
Honourably filled, they hope for a continuance of his Brotherly
Love, Aid and information and finally that he be requested to
receive the best wishes of the Grand Lodge for a prolongation of
his useful life, a commensurate enjoyment of his Health and his
final Happiness in the Mansion of Everlasting Rest."</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother Joseph Few, Deputy Grand Master, was also a Revolutionary
Soldier, having served as Regimental Quarter Master with the 4th
Continental Artillery.</p>

<p>Brother Thomas Procter, Senior Grand Warden, formerly Colonel of the
Pennsylvania Artillery, and Warrant Master of the Military Lodge, No.
19, upon the Roster of Pennsylvania was prominent in both civil and
political affairs during <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s administration. A full account of

<h3><span class="smcap">Correspondence with Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, December, 1796.</span></h3>


<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">September</span> 18, 1796, President <span class="smcap">Washington</span> issued his farewell address.
His second term was drawing to a close; the term had been a more or less
exciting one: The passing of the Neutrality Act; Genet's appeal from the
executive to the people; the Fugitive Slave Act; the whiskey
insurrection in western Pennsylvania; the adoption of the Eleventh
amendment; the purchase of peace from Algiers, Tripoli and Tunis; the
troubles with Great Britain about the non-delivery of the military posts
and later the Jay Treaty, all came within President <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s second
and last term.<small><a name="f58.1" id="f58.1" href="#f58">[58]</a></small></p>

<p>During these troublous times <span class="smcap">Washington</span> had no stauncher supporters than
his Masonic Brethren of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. Further, that
<span class="smcap">Washington</span> kept more or less in touch with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>his Masonic Brethren of the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania is shown by the fact that he attended the
services at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, on Third Street below Walnut,
on St. John's Day, December 27, 1793, where a charity sermon was
preached by Rev. Brother Samuel Magaw, D.D., Vice-Provost of the
University of Pennsylvania, before the Grand and Subordinate Lodges for
the purpose of increasing the relief fund, for the widows and orphans of
the yellow fever epidemic which ravaged the capital city during the past
summer.<small><a name="f59.1" id="f59.1" href="#f59">[59]</a></small></p>

<p>When the Brethren found that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> positively declined re&euml;lection
in 1796, and that John Adams was elected to succeed him on the fourth of
March following, the Brethren of the Grand Lodge at their Quarterly
Communication, December 5, 1796, determined that it would be right and
proper to present him with an address before his retirement from office,
whereupon, it was resolved: "On Motion and seconded, that a Committee be
appointed to frame an Address to be presented on the ensuing Feast of
S<sup>t</sup> John, Decem<sup>r</sup> 27th, to the Great Master Workman, our Illustrious Br.
Washington, on the occasion of his intended retirement from Public
Labor, to be also laid before the said Grand Lodge on St John's Day, and
the R<sup>t</sup> W. Grand Master, Deputy G. M. B<sup>rs</sup> Sadler, Milnor and Williams,
were accordingly appointed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>At a Grand Lodge held on St. John's Day, Philadelphia, December 27,
5796, "The Committee appointed to prepare an Address to our Brother
George Washington, President of the United States, presented an Address
by them drawn up, which was ordered to be read, and was in the words
following, to wit:</p>


<div class="letter">
<p>"To <span class="smcap">George Washington President of The United States</span>.</p>

<p>"The Address of the Grand Lodge of Pennsyl-<br />"vania.</p>

"<i>Public Labour</i> to that <i>Refreshment</i> to which your<br />
"pre&euml;minent Services for near Half a Century have<br />
"so justly entitled you. Permit the Grand Lodge<br />
"of Pennsylvania at this last Feast of our Evangelic<br />
"Master St. John, on which we can hope for an im-<br />
"mediate Communication with you to join the grate-<br />
"ful Voice of our Country in Acknowledging that<br />
"you have carried forth the Principles of the Lodge<br />
"into every Walk of your Life, by your constant<br />
"Labours for the Prosperity of that Country, by<br />
"your unremitting Endeavours to promote Order,<br />
"Union and Brotherly Affection amongst us, and<br />
"lastly by the Vows of your Farewell Address to<br />
"your Brethren and Fellow Citizens. An Address<br />
"which we trust Our Children and Our Childrens<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>"Children will ever look upon as a most invaluable<br />
"Legacy from a <i>Friend</i> a <i>Benefactor</i> and a <i>Father</i>.<br />
<br />
"To these our grateful Acknowledgments (leav-<br />
"ing to the impartial Pen of History to record the<br />
"important Events in which you have borne so illus-<br />
"trious a part) permit us to add our most fervent<br />
"prayers, that after enjoying to the utmost of<br />
"Human Life, every Felicity which the Terrestial<br />
"Lodge can afford, you may be received by the<br />
"great Master Builder of this World and of Worlds<br />
"unnumbered, into the Ample Felicity of that <i>Celes-</i><br />

"distinguished Labours can be eternally rewarded.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was then moved and seconded that the same be adopted. Upon the
question being taken it appeared that it was approved of. On motion and
seconded, it was agreed that a committee be appointed to wait on Brother
<span class="smcap">Washington</span> to acquaint him that it is the intention of this Grand Lodge
to present an address to him, and to know what time he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> shall be pleased
to appoint to receive it. The committee appointed to perform this duty
were Brothers William Smith, Peter Le Barbier Duplessis and Thomas
Procter, who, after having waited on him, reported that he had appointed
to-morrow, December 28, 1796, at twelve o'clock to receive it. Said
committee, to wit, Brothers W. Smith, Duplessis and Procter, together
with Right Worshipful Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, and Junior
Wardens, Grand Secretary and the Masters of the different Lodges in the
City, were then appointed a Deputation to present the said Address.</p>

<p>This deputation consisted of Right Worshipful Grand Master William Moore
Smith, Gavin Hamilton, Deputy Grand Master, Thomas Town, Senior Grand
Warden, Thomas Armstrong, Esq<sup>r</sup>., Junior Grand Warden, George A.
Baker, Grand Secretary, John McElwee, Grand Treasurer, and the following
Masters of the Philadelphia Lodges, viz.: David Irwin, No. 2, Israel
Israel, No. 3, Andrew Nilson No. 9, Eleaser Oswald, No. 19, Cadawalder
Griffith, No. 52, Richard E. Cusack, No. 59, Thomas Bradley, No. 67,
William Nelson, No. 71; together with the appointed Committee, Brothers
William Smith D.D., Le Barbier Duplessis and Thomas Procter.</p>

<p>President <span class="smcap">Washington</span> received the august deputation of the Brethren at
the appointed time; the address was read before him by the Rev. Brother
William Smith, D.D., whereupon he returned them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> a reply. This
document, still in the Library of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, is
entirely in the handwriting of <span class="smcap">Washington</span> and signed by him, viz.:</p>

<br />
"To have been, in any degree, an<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>Brother William Moore Smith, Right Worshipful Grand Master of
Pennsylvania, whose first official act as Grand Master was to head the
committee to call on the President, was a son of the Rev. William Smith,
D.D., born in Philadelphia, June 1, 1759. He was a lawyer by profession
and served as Deputy Grand Master for the year 1795 under the Venerable
William Ball, and as Right Worshipful Grand Master for the years
1796-1797. He was appointed by the President as agent for the settlement
of claims that were provided for in the Sixth Article of John Jay's
Treaty, and visited England in 1803 to close the commission. He died at
the Smith Homestead at Falls of Schuylkill, March 12, 1821.</p>

<p>Both the address and reply were copied in <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s Letter Book III,
pp. 244-245, in the handwriting of one of his secretaries, G. W. Craik,
a son of Dr. James Craik, <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s "compatriot in arms, and old and
intimate friend," who attended him during his last illness.</p>

<p>Photostat copies of above are in the Library of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania, also the original draft of the address, presented to the
President (Mss. Volume A, folio 23).</p>

<p>This autograph Masonic letter from <span class="smcap">Washington</span> to the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania has been reproduced in fac-simile, published and circulated
(in most cases without the knowledge or consent of the Grand Lodge of
Pennsylvania) more widely than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> any other known letter of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>.
Some of these copies are treasured by their owners under the impression
that they have the original letter. Several cases of this kind have of
late come under the notice of the writer. In one case where one of these
reproductions was offered for sale, hundreds of dollars were asked for
the reproduction, and it was with great difficulty that the owner could
be convinced of its character.</p>

<p>Another use made of this letter by unprincipled persons was to make a
photo-lithographic copy of the letter, and substitute the name of
another state for that of Pennsylvania, and then palm it off upon the
authorities of that state as an original letter to their Grand Lodge.
The latest case of this kind known to the writer is that of the Grand
Lodge of Georgia, who were thus imposed upon.</p>

<p>Then again the letter has been extensively used for advertising purposes
by publishing houses of Masonic literature.</p>

<p>The letter has also been printed in most all books bearing upon Masonic
history during the revolutionary period.</p>

<p>It was also frequently quoted and criticised during the Anti-Masonic
craze which swept over the country some eighty-odd years ago, it being
the chief Masonic letter of the five known to the leaders of those
misguided persons. The main point of their argument was that it bore no
date and therefore was not authentic.</p>

<p><i>To Their Most Worthy George Washington.</i>"</p>

<p>"Wishing ever to be foremost in testimonials of respect and
admiration for those virtues and services with which you have so
long adorned and benefited our common country; and not the last nor
least, to regret the cessation of them, in the public councils of
the Union; your Brethren of the Grand Lodge embrace the earliest
opportunity of greeting you in the calm retirement you have
contemplated to yourself. Though as citizens they lose you in the
active labors of political life, they hope, as Masons, to find you
in the pleasing sphere of Fraternal engagement.</p>

<p>"From the cares of state and the fatigues of public business our
institution opens a recess affording all the relief of tranquility,
the harmony of peace and the refreshment of pleasure. Of these may
you partake in all their purity and satisfaction; and we will
assure ourselves that your attachment to this social plan will
increase; and that under the auspices of your encouragement,
assistance and patronage, the Craft will attain its highest
ornament, perfection and praise. And it is our ardent prayer, that
when your light shall be no more visible in this earthly temple,
you may be raised to the All Perfect Lodge above; be seated on the
right of the Supreme Architect of the Universe, and there receive
the refreshment your labors merited.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">In</span> the year 1798, the danger of a war with France had become so
imminent, on account of the aggressions of that government towards the
United States, that Congress ordered a provisional army to be raised,
the command of which was tendered to <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, with the rank of
Lieutenant-General, an honor which was reluctantly accepted by
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>. During the summer a scourge of yellow fever had again
visited Philadelphia, which caused Congress to adjourn, July 16, and the
public offices to be removed for the time being to Trenton, N. J. All
danger of the fever being over, <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, on November 5, started for
Trenton. He arrived at Baltimore, November 7, and was waited on at his
quarters by William Belton, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Maryland,
his Deputy and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> Brethren and presented with a copy of the New

wrote this letter to the Maryland Brethren.</p>

German, born and liberally educated | in the city of Heydelberg, in
the Pa | latinate of the Rhine. I came to this | Country in 1776, and
felt soon after my | arrival, a close Attachment to the | Liberty for
which these confederated | States then struggled. The same
attachment | still remains not glowing, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> burning in | my Breast.
At the same Time that I am | exulting in the Measures adopted by
our | Government, I feel myself elevated in | the Idea of my adopted
Country, I am | attached, both from the Bent of Educa | tion and
mature Enquiry and Search | to the simple Doctrines of Christianity, |
which I have the Honor to teach in | Public; and I do heartily
Despise all the | Cavils of Infidelity. Our present Time | pregnant
with the most shocking Events | and Calamities, threatens Ruin to |
our Liberty and Government. | The most secret Plans are in
Agitation; | Plans calculated to ensnare the Unwary, | to attract the
Gay irreligious, and to | entice even the Well-Disposed to combine
in | the general Machine for overturning all | Government and all
Religion.</p>

<p>"It was some Time since that a Book | fell into my hands, entitled
'Proofs | of a Conspiracy, &amp;c. by John Robison,' which | gives a full
Account of a Society of Free | Masons, that distinguishes itself by
the | name of 'Illuminati,' whose Plan is to over | throw all
Government and all Religion, even | natural; and who endeavor to
eradicate | every Idea of a Supreme Being, and distin | guish Man from
Beast by his shape only. | A Thought suggested itself to me, that
some | of the Lodges in the United States might | have caught the
Infection, and might co-oper | ate with the Illuminati or the Jacobin
Club | in France. Fauchet is mentioned by Robinson | as a zealous
Member; and who can doubt | Genet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> Adet? Have not these their
con | fidants in this country? They use the same | Expressions, and
are generally Men of no | Religion. Upon serious Reflection I was
led | to think that it might be within your | Power to prevent the
horrid Plan from | corrupting the Brethren of the English Lodges |
over which you preside.</p>

<p>"I send you the 'Proof of a Conspiracy,' &amp;c. | which I doubt not,
will give you Satis | faction, and afford you matter for a | Train of
ideas, that may operate to our | national Felicity. If, however, you
have | already perused the Book, it will not, | I trust, be
disagreeable to you that I | have presumed to address you with this |
Letter and the Book accompanying it. | It proceeded from the
Sincerity of my | Heart, and my ardent Wishes for the | common Good.</p>

<p>"May the Supreme Ruler of all | Things continue You long with us in |
these perilous Times: may he endow you | with Strength and Wisdom to

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>This man Snyder (Schneider) was an agitator and thoroughly irresponsible
person, having no ecclesiastical connection with any organized Church
Body.</p>

<p>In the year 1787, Schneider came from Albany, New York, to Frederick,
ostensibly to collect money to build a Church. He was kindly received
and permitted to preach in the Reformed Congregation, where he soon
fomented discord and trouble.</p>

<p>Schneider was soon driven out of Frederick Town, but returned again in
1794, when he renewed the trouble in the Church, which ended in a
schism. The matter finally got into the Civil Court, and on February 15,
1800 the case was decided against him, which ended his activity in
Frederick Town; soon after which he left for parts unknown.<small><a name="f67.1" id="f67.1" href="#f67">[67]</a></small></p>

<p>Snyder, who was not a native of this country, evidently labored under
the impression that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was a Grand Master General, who presided
over all of the English (or Symbolic) Masonic Lodges in the United
States. Snyder evidently used the term "English" Lodges, to distinguish
them from the Masonic bodies working in the so-called higher (Scotch)
degrees, as are now known as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.</p>

<p>How important <span class="smcap">Washington</span> considered this correspondence is shown by his
precaution in taking a press copy of both of his letters to Snyder, who
he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>was led to believe was the regular pastor of the German Reformed
Congregation at Fredericktown. These are now in the Library of Congress.
It will be noted that in all of his other Masonic correspondence, copies
were made in his regular letter books by his clerks, of both address and
reply. Brother <span class="smcap">Washington</span> evidently surmised that this letter from
Snyder was nothing more or less than a scheme to entrap him. It was not
until a month had elapsed, and then only after due consideration, that
the following reply was sent to Fredericktown, viz.:</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>In this letter <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was correct in stating that he had not
presided over the "English Lodges in this Country," undoubtedly meaning
as Grand Master General.</p>

<p>Where <span class="smcap">Washington</span> says "<i>The fact is I preside over none</i>," he meant that
he did not then preside over any individual lodge, as he at that time
was a Past Master of Alexandria Lodge, No. 22, of Virginia.<small><a name="f68.1" id="f68.1" href="#f68">[68]</a></small></p>

<p>Where he says "<i>Nor have I been in one</i>, [meaning an individual lodge]
<i>more than once or twice within the last thirty years</i>," he obviously
had in view his occasional visits to the various lodges during that
period, and that he could not, on account of his official duties and
other conditions, attend any lodge regularly.</p>

<p>As a matter of record, <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was a member of Alexandria Lodge, No.
39, of Pennsylvania,<small><a name="f69.1" id="f69.1" href="#f69">[69]</a></small> and attended some of its meetings at Alexandria
in 1783 and 1784, as is shown by the Minutes of the Lodge, and the
records here presented.<small><a name="f70.1" id="f70.1" href="#f70">[70]</a></small> Further, that when the Brethren of
Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, changed their allegiance from Pennsylvania to
Virginia, General <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was especially named in the warrant, after
his consent having been <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>first obtained,<small><a name="f71.1" id="f71.1" href="#f71">[71]</a></small>
and thereby became the Warrant Master of Lodge No. 22, under the Virginia jurisdiction, April
28, 1788, serving as such until December 20 following, when, as the
minutes of that date show,<small><a name="f72.1" id="f72.1" href="#f72">[72]</a></small> he was unanimously elected to succeed
himself for the full term, serving in all about twenty months.</p>

<p>The records further show that, in 1778, <span class="smcap">Washington</span> occupied the chief
position in the procession at the celebration of St. John the Evangelist
by the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia in 1778, in which
more than three hundred Brethren joined.<small><a name="f73.1" id="f73.1" href="#f73">[73]</a></small></p>

<p>He also occupied the same position when he laid the corner stone of the
present capitol at Washington, September 18, 1793, clothed with the
Masonic Apron presented by Lafayette, which is now in the Museum of the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. Upon both of these occasions, <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
made a public profession of his membership in the Masonic Fraternity.</p>

<p>Records show that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was present at the meeting of American
Union Lodge (a Military <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>Lodge), at Morristown, N. J., December 27,
1779;<small><a name="f74.1" id="f74.1" href="#f74">[74]</a></small> at American Union Lodge at Nelson's point on the Hudson June
24, 1782;<small><a name="f75.1" id="f75.1" href="#f75">[75]</a></small> at King Solomon's Lodge of Poughkeepsie, December 27,
1782, and occasionally at Alexandria Lodge, No. 39, in 1783-1784, and
the Virginia Lodge, No. 22, between the years 1788 and 1797.<small><a name="f76.1" id="f76.1" href="#f76">[76]</a></small></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington</span> in the next paragraph of his letter to Snyder makes his
meaning absolutely clear, that while he had not attended any Lodge
regularly during the past thirty years he plainly states: "I believe
notwithstanding, that none of the Lodges in this Country are
contaminated with the principles ascribed to the society of the Illuminati."</p>

<p>This belief is further accentuated by the letter to the Grand Lodge of
Maryland a few weeks after the above letter was written to Snyder.</p>

<p>In addition to above records, there are numerous traditions of
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s occasional visits to Masonic Lodges and functions:<small><a name="f77.1" id="f77.1" href="#f77">[77]</a></small> all
of which fall within the thirty years mentioned in the Snyder
Letter.<small><a name="f78.1" id="f78.1" href="#f78">[78]</a></small></p>

<p>Further, <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s great interest in Free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>masonry is shown by the
many addresses received from different Grand and Subordinate Lodges
throughout the Union, all of which he acknowledged in fraternal terms,
also by the various Masonic constitutions and sermons dedicated to him,
which he received with thanks and were preserved in his library.</p>

<p>It will be noted that in the fifth line from the bottom, "<i>Within the
last thirty years</i>," which in all Anti-Masonic publications is printed
in italics, the word "<i>thirty</i>" was not in the body of the letter as
originally written, but was an afterthought and interlined before the press copy was taken.</p>

<p>In the press copy of this letter, it will be noted that the word written
over the words "<i>last years</i>," is almost indecipherable; in the
photostat it is completely so. This has led some investigators to
question whether the interlined word is really "<i>thirty</i>."</p>

<p>The surmise that the blur in the press copy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Washington</span>'s letter to
Snyder, was "thirty" was first promulgated by Jared Sparks, when he
furnished the text of the letter to the Anti-Masonic agitators, during
the political excitement which swept over the New England States in the
second decade of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Snyder, upon receipt of this letter, undoubtedly after consultation with
persons who were politically opposed to <span class="smcap">Washington</span> or antagonistic to
the Masonic Fraternity, wrote a second letter and sent it to Mount
Vernon under date of October 17, 1798; no copy of this letter has thus
far been found among the <span class="smcap">Washington</span> papers in the Library of Congress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington</span> immediately sent the following sharp reply to Snyder, in
which he plainly sets forth his belief that the Masonic Lodges in the
United States were not interested in the propagation of the tenets of
what was then known as Jacobism or the <ins class="correction" title="Original reads 'Illumaniti'.">Illuminati</ins>. The words as
underscored in the original letter by <span class="smcap">Washington</span> were to emphasize his
meaning upon this subject.</p>

<p>Photostats of both of the above letter press copies are in the Archives
of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a historical fact that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> had always retained the highest
respect for the people of Maryland, and especially the citizens of
Frederick County. No man ever stood higher in the estimation of the
people of Maryland than <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, and his death awakened genuine
sorrow. On February 22d, 1800, memorial services were observed in the
Reformed Church at Fredericktown.<small><a name="f79.1" id="f79.1" href="#f79">[79]</a></small> It was a solemn day and the whole
County was in mourning; at which time Ex-Governor Thomas Johnson
pronounced the funeral oration. Snyder took no part in these services.</p>

<p>The two letters to Snyder were chiefly relied upon by the Anti-Masons to
support their political claims.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>"That Washington was never in a Lodge but twice, in his life; that
he paid no attention to Masonry during the war; that in 1781 he
declined being addressed by Masons as a brother Mason, and in 1798
was very particular to insist upon the fact that he had not been in
a Lodge, but once or twice in 30 years, and knew nothing of their
principles and practices."<small><a name="f80.1" id="f80.1" href="#f80">[80]</a></small></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How false these statements so frequently made, is shown by the many
proofs here presented in fac-simile of the originals, which also
absolutely controvert the statement in Governor Ritner's Vindication? viz:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That all the letters said to be written by Washington to Lodges
are spurious. This is rendered nearly certain: First, by the
non-production of the originals: Second, by the absence of copies
among the records of his letters: Third, by their want of dates:
Fourth, by the fact that his intimate friend and biographer, Chief
Justice Marshall,<small><a name="f81.1" id="f81.1" href="#f81">[81]</a></small> (himself a Mason in his youth,) says that he
never heard Washington utter a syllable on the subject, a matter
nearly impossible, if Washington had for years been engaged in
writing laudatory letters to the Grand Lodges of South Carolina,
Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts."<small><a name="f82.1" id="f82.1" href="#f82">[82]</a></small></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The movement to elect General <span class="smcap">Washington</span> a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>Grand Master over all the
Brethren in the United States originated at a meeting of American Union
Lodge, held at the encampment of the American Army at Morristown, New
Jersey, December 15, 1779. This Lodge was a Regimental Lodge of the
Connecticut Line, originally warranted by the Provincial Grand Master of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>This movement continued to find favor amongst the craft, especially in
Pennsylvania, and culminated in a motion to that effect at a General
Grand Communication of the Grand Lodge, December 20, 1779.</p>

<p>This resulted in a Grand Lodge of Emergency being convened January 13,
1780, when the following action was taken:<small><a name="f83.1" id="f83.1" href="#f83">[83]</a></small></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This Lodge being called by Order of the Grand Master, upon the
request of Sundry Brethren, and also in pursuance of a Motion made
at the last General Communication, to consider the Propriety as
well as the necessity of appointing a Grand Master over all the
Grand Lodges formed or to be formed in these United States, as the
Correspondence which the Rules of Masonry require cannot now be
carried on with the Grand Lodge of London, under whose Jurisdiction
the Grand Lodges in these States were originally constituted; The
Ballot was put upon the Question: Whether it be for the Benefit of
Masonry that 'a Grand Master of Masons thro'out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> United States'
shall be now nominated on the part of this Grand Lodge; and it was
unanimously determined in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Sundry respectable Brethren being then put in nomination, it was
moved that the Ballot be put for them separately, and His
Excellency George Washington, Esquire, General and
Commander-in-chief of the Armies of the United States being first
in nomination, he was ballotted for accordingly as Grand Master,
and Elected by the unanimous vote of the whole Lodge.</p>

<p>"Ordered, That the minutes of this Election and appointment be
transmitted to the different Grand Lodges in the United States, and
their Concurrence therein be requested, in Order that application
be made to his Excellency in due form, praying that he will do the
Brethren and Craft the honor of accepting their appointment. A
Committee was appointed to expedite the Business."</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The movement was further advanced at a Convention of representatives of
the Army Lodges, held at Morristown, N. J., on February 7, 1780, when,
fortified by the pronounced action of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, a
committee was chosen of which Brother Mordecai Gist of Maryland was
chairman and Brother Otho Williams of Delaware, secretary.<small><a name="f84.1" id="f84.1" href="#f84">[84]</a></small></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To the RIGHT WORSHIPFUL, The Grand Masters of the several Lodges
in the Respective United States of America.</p>

<p>"UNION&mdash;&mdash;FORCE&mdash;&mdash;LOVE."</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This address was signed by representatives of no less than seven states,
viz.: Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts
Bay, New York and Delaware; in addition to those of the American Union
Lodge, Artillery, St. John's Regimental Lodge and the Staff of the
American Army.</p>

<p>It was further ordered that the foregoing address with an exact copy of
these proceedings signed by the President and Secretary, be sent to the
respective Provincial Grand Masters in the United States.<small><a name="f85.1" id="f85.1" href="#f85">[85]</a></small></p>

<p>It was not until the middle of October that a reply was received from
the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to the circular letter sent out by the
Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, and then only in response to a letter
written by our Grand Secretary, Rev. Brother Dr. William Smith.</p>

<p>This matter led to more or less correspondence between the Grand Lodges
of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and was in abeyance, until January,
1781, when the following letter was received from Joseph Webb, Grand
Master of Massachusetts.<small><a name="f86.1" id="f86.1" href="#f86">[86]</a></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The belief that <span class="smcap">Washington</span> was the Grand Master of the United States was
widespread, and, as our late Bro. James M. Lamberton said in his address
before mentioned,<small><a name="f87.1" id="f87.1" href="#f87">[87]</a></small> notwithstanding the fact that the project to
elevate General <span class="smcap">Washington</span> fell through, "that the action of the Army
Lodges and of our Grand Lodge got abroad, is shown by translations of
two letters from a Lodge at Cape Francois,<small><a name="f88.1" id="f88.1" href="#f88">[88]</a></small> on the island of San
Domingo, directed to General <span class="smcap">Washington</span> as Grand Master of all America,
soliciting a charter, which were presented to our Grand Lodge, February
3, 1786. The same <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>thing is shown by a medal struck in 1797, the obverse
showing the bust of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, with the legend, "G. Washington
President. 1797," the reverse showing many Masonic emblems,<small><a name="f89.1" id="f89.1" href="#f89">[89]</a></small> with the
legend "Amor. Honor. Et Justica G.W.G.G.M." (<i>i. e.,</i> George Washington, General Grand Master).</p>

<p>The writer of the letters to <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, Snyder, quoted at the beginning
of this chapter, being of foreign birth, and not a member of the Masonic
Fraternity, nor even living where a Masonic Lodge existed, evidently
labored under the same delusion as the Brethren at Cape Francois.</p>

<p>The Masonic Correspondence of <span class="smcap">Washington</span> as represented upon these
pages, should settle for all time to come the question, as to the esteem
in which <span class="smcap">Washington</span> held the Masonic Fraternity, of which he was an
honored Member.</p>

<p>It is stated that there are still a large number of Washington papers in
the Library of Congress, that are not accessible, as they have thus far
not been classified or indexed. Thus it is in the possibilities that
there may be still further documentary evidence found of Masonic import,
in addition to such as are set forth upon these pages.</p>
